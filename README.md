Skill trees creation and sharing


TODO list

it expands faster than reduces...
not sorted yet

- Transfer dev database to prod

- Rework the interface
	- add a banyan tree skill
	- define a graphic charter

- export
	- add a JSON export button
	- export as a nice SVG
	
- share on social media
	
- separate the local javascript and the javascript library to display the JSON files to allow external users to display the JSON code in any page

- add a rating system to rate the skilltrees

- search function
	- make it better
	- merge searching on tags and on name and description
- add an arborescence for browsing
	- define where to display other than the main page
	
- add a news/blog system for the front page?

- fill in the README.md

- add containers to the skill trees to make zones
	- drag skills inside the container
	
- on saving, update the name of the div, because now on every save, new divs are replacing themselves (causing a destroy create every time until the page is refreshed and the grap loaded properly)
	- forcing a refresh is the easy way but would not be nice for the user
	
- publishing trees //TODO IMPORTANT FOR TESTING IN PROD WITH REAL USERS
	- tree is private until published, once published he can't be private again but can still be modified (by who)
	
- copy a whole tree to another account (example: to modify it)
- set tags non clickable with jquery when displaying a graph (and the categories)

-add glyphicons to menus
